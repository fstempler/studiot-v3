                    <p className='Glearning__hero-challenge-text'>Graceful by Design began as a faith-based brand offering inspirational products. But when they decided to expand their offerings to include educational tools, they faced a challenge: How could they create a distinct brand for their hands-on learning products without losing the core values that defined their original business?</p>
                </div>

                    <div className='Glearning__hero-challenge-text1'>
                        <p>They needed a brand that captured the excitement of interactive learning while maintaining the warmth and intentionality they had already established. That brand became Grooved Learning.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div className='Glearning__hero-challenge-text2'>
                        <p>Founded by a former middle school teacher who left the classroom to homeschool her own children, Grooved Learning was more than a businessâ€”it was a mission. But before we could bring it to life, we needed to define what set it apart.</p>

                        <p>Rather than repositioning their existing brand, we helped them develop a bold new identity that fully embraced education as an adventure. We focused on three key elements to bring Grooved Learning to life:</p>

                        <p className='Glearning__hero-solution-bulletts-text2'>Grooved Learning needed a name, a look, and a voice that felt dynamic, tactile, and fun.
